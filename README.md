# CSE327_eCommerce_Website

Modern technologies are being created to make daily work easier. In the age of globalisation and urbanisation, technology is improved and upgraded for society's general progress. Accessing healthcare services and products has always been vital to modern society. Physical pharmacies have traditionally been the go-to source for medicines and medical supplies. However, physical pharmacies are not always convenient for everyone, especially those with mobility challenges or those who live in remote areas. Waiting times at physical pharmacies can also be long, making it difficult for customers to obtain the products they need in a timely manner. To address these challenges, our team proposes developing an e-commerce website for a pharmacy. This website will deliver to consumers nationwide with a convenient and secure platform to purchase medicines and healthcare products online.
